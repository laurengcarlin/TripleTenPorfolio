You’ve been hired as a junior analyst at an e-commerce company to analyze user activity data from raw transaction logs. Each row of data in the "raw_user_activity" tab represents an event by a user on the website, such as product views, cart interactions, or purchases. Your project will focus on building a conversion funnel, preparing data for cohort analysis, calculating retention rates, and presenting results professionally.

Project Steps:

Build a Conversion Funnel
Using data from the "raw_user_activity" tab, create a 3-stage funnel in a pivot table to analyze how well product views convert into purchases.
Calculate overall conversion rates and the rates for each funnel stage transition.
Prepare Data for Cohort Analysis
Isolate purchase events into a new "purchase_activity" sheet.
Identify each user’s first purchase date and use it to assign users to monthly acquisition cohorts.
Create columns for event_month, first_purchase_month, and cohort_age to track users by month.
Calculate Retention Rates
Group purchases by cohorts in a new pivot table for "cohort_analysis" and track monthly retention rates.
In a "retention_rates" sheet, calculate retention percentages for each cohort over time.
Organize and Document the Spreadsheet
Fill in the "Executive Summary" with findings on the conversion funnel and retention rates.
Explain assumptions and methods, reorder sheet tabs for clarity, and format for readability.
