This project involves analyzing user activity logs from an e-commerce website to generate valuable business metrics,
focusing on user conversion, cohort analysis, and retention rates. The analysis starts by building a conversion funnel to track
how users move from product page views to purchases. It continues with data preparation for cohort analysis by isolating purchase events,
calculating first purchase dates, and creating cohort groups based on users' first purchase month.
Finally, retention rates are calculated by grouping users into cohorts and tracking their retention month over month. 
The final deliverables include organized and documented spreadsheets with clear analysis, executive summaries, 
and well-structured results ready for presentation to the companyâ€™s executive team.
