This project involves analyzing data from the Shopify App Store using Power BI to identify key factors influencing the success of apps.
You will create visualizations to explore app statistics, including the number of unique apps, review trends over time,
and the relationship between review count and ratings. Additionally, you will evaluate the impact of developer responses on ratings,
calculate weighted review scores, and analyze developer responsiveness by examining helpful reviews and review counts. 
The final deliverable will be a Power BI report that addresses these insights using multiple visualizations and DAX calculations.
